# Jonesdebu COVID-19 REACT native application
## About
This is a mini project to practice working with REACT native and Javascript to display data from a COVID-19 API. It is developed and tested through the expo cli for IOS devices.

## How it works
For learning purposes the app is split into three branches to focus on the individual components.

All Branches can be run by using `npm start` in your terminal.

Note: If the tunnel fails to run start correctly run `npm start --tunnel`
